## LiteNetCNN

LiteNetCNN is a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for garment classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. 
This model aims to provide a lightweight and efficient architecture while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to established CNN models such as AlexNet, LeNet, ResNet, and a generic CNN.
#### LiteNetCNN weighs the lightest with just 41,610 total parameters without any non-trainable or optimizer parameters, which speaks to the model's simplicity and efficiency.

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark for machine learning algorithms, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items in 10 categories. 
LiteNetCNN is designed to optimize performance for this classification task while reducing computational overhead.

LiteNetCNN achieved the following performance metrics:

#### Train Accuracy: 90.04%
#### Test Accuracy: 88.66%
#### Precision: 0.9842
#### Recall: 0.9784
These results demonstrate competitive performance compared to AlexNet, LeNet, ResNet, and the Generic CNN model. Detailed results will be available in the evaluation report.
